### TDDD23 Game Project Plan - Wizard Arcade

# Game Idea

Wizard Arcade is a retro strategic maze-based arcade-style game, where the play-
er(s) battle each other or the AI inside a single-screen arena. The aim is for
the player to score victories by blowing the opponents to bits through spells.

# Game Tech
The game will be developed in Unity.

# Progression in the Game
Single-player mode will offer a tutorial with increasing complexity (more spells,
more AI-players) until all elements have been introduced at which point the full
arena mode is available with multiple difficulties on the AI (decreased reaction
times, possibly combination attacks, details yet to be decided).

# In-game tutoring approach
Basic movement will be chosen upon game start, allowing the player to chose 
between "WSAD" and "Arrows" controls. From there on, the tutorial will introduce
elements one-by-one, unlocking the arena mode by the time it is completed. More 
advanced "playstyle feature hints" might be included as loading screens.
